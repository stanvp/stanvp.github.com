I am an Applied Research Scientist at Facebook. Previously, I worked on Alexa's natural langauge understanding (NLU) and entity resulation (ER) at Amazon. My research interests are in deep Learning, natural language processing, and virtual assistants. I was part of the team that launched the Alexa virtual-assistant in November 2014.
